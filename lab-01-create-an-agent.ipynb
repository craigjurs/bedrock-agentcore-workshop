    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "[Amazon Bedrock AgentCore](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/agentcore/) helps you deploying and operating AI agents securely at scale - using any framework and model. It provides you with the capability to move from prototype to production faster. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this 6-labs tutorial, we will demonstrate the end-to-end journey from prototype to production using an **American Red Cross Customer Service Chatbot**. For this example we will use [Strands Agents](https://strandsagents.com/latest/), a simple-to-use, code-first framework for building agents and the Anthropic Claude Haiku 4.5 model from Amazon Bedrock. For your application you can use the framework and model of your choice. It's important to note that the concepts covered here can be applied using other frameworks and models as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Workshop Journey:**\n",
    "- **Lab 1 (Current)**: Create Agent Prototype - Build a functional chatbot with access to multiple knowledge bases\n",
    "- **Lab 2**: Enhance with Memory - Add conversation context and personalization\n",
    "- **Lab 3**: Scale with Gateway & Identity - Share tools across agents securely\n",
    "- **Lab 4**: Deploy to Production - Use AgentCore Runtime with observability\n",
    "- **Lab 5**: Evaluate Agent Performance - Monitor quality with online evaluations\n",
    "- **Lab 6**: Build User Interface - Create a customer-facing application\n",
    "\n",
    "In this first lab, we'll build an American Red Cross Customer Service Chatbot prototype that will evolve throughout the workshop into a production-ready system serving multiple users with persistent memory, shared tools, and full observability. Our chatbot will have access to three separate knowledge bases covering different lines of business:\n",
    "- **search_biomedical_knowledge_base()** - Access Biomedical Services information (blood drives, appointments, locations)\n",
    "- **search_humanitarian_knowledge_base()** - Access Humanitarian Services information (relief centers, grant applications)\n",
    "- **search_training_services_knowledge_base()** - Access Training Services information (first aid classes, schedules, registrations)\n",
    "- **web_search()** - Search the web for general information\n",
